# Responsive Coming Soon Landing Page

A small front-end project that demonstrates a responsive “Coming Soon” landing page using HTML and CSS.

This project focuses on mobile-first layout, custom typography, responsive imagery, and adapting content for different screen sizes without using any frameworks.

## Purpose

This project was built to:

* Practice mobile-first responsive design.

* Work with custom fonts using @font-face.

* Build a marketing-style landing page layout.

* Reinforce layout changes using media queries.

* Improve confidence with CSS positioning and imagery.

## Features

* “Coming Soon” landing page layout.
* Brand logo displayed at the top of the page.
* Headline and descriptive text for user engagement.
* Email input form for future announcements.
* Custom typography using external font files.
* Mobile and desktop-specific layouts.
* Responsive images that change based on screen size.
* Desktop layout enhanced with a clipped hero image.

## Tech Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3

## How It Works

The page is structured using container elements to control layout and spacing.
* The mobile view displays a centered layout with a hero image and form.
* Custom fonts are loaded using @font-face.
* CSS controls spacing, typography, and alignment.
* A media query updates the layout for larger screens:
    * Mobile image is hidden.
    * Desktop background and hero image are displayed.
    * Typography scales for larger viewports.
    * A clipped image shape is applied using clip-path.

## Styling Notes

* @font-face is used to load custom fonts.
* Flexbox helps control basic layout flow.
* Media queries handle responsive behavior.
* Background images are swapped based on screen size.
* clip-path is used to create a custom image shape on desktop.
